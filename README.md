# Overview

This project is a note-taking application designed to enhance my skills as a software engineer and deepen my understanding of integrating frontend and backend technologies with a cloud database. The application allows users to add and view notes. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, while MongoDB serves as the cloud database to store and retrieve notes. The application is deployed on Heroku.

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create a full-stack web application, integrate it with a cloud database, and deploy it to a cloud platform for easy access and scalability.



# Cloud Database

The cloud database used for this project is MongoDB Atlas, a highly scalable and flexible NoSQL database. MongoDB Atlas provides a fully managed database service, making it easy to deploy, operate, and scale MongoDB in the cloud.

The database structure consists of two collections named `notes` and `categories`, where each is stored as a document. Each document has the following structure:

- `content`: A string representing the content of the note.
- `createdAt`: A date indicating when the note was created.

# Development Environment

The development environment for this project includes the following tools and technologies:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful code editor used for writing and editing the code.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to create the backend server.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: A cloud database service used to store and retrieve notes.
- **Heroku**:  A cloud platform that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It supports deploying the entire application, including its frontend, backend, and server-side functions. Heroku provides a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that supports various programming languages and frameworks, allowing you to deploy full-stack applications seamlessly
The primary programming language used is JavaScript, along with the following libraries and dependencies:

- **mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **dotenv**: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **body-parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- **cors**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

# Future Work

There are several enhancements and features that I plan to implement in the future:

- Add user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own notes.
- Enhance the user interface with better styling and usability features.
- Integrate additional cloud services to extend functionality, such as notifications or backups.
